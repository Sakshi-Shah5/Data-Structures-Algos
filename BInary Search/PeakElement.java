//leetcode 162

//note: it's not a sorted array, that's the trick of the question. The technique is same (divide and conquer approach) but itâ€™s not exactly binary search.


//algo :
//first, find mid element and compare it to the next element 
//if that element is less than it's next element, then we know that it's definitely not the peak element as it's less than it's next element, so the peak element could be the one on it's right, therefore low = mid+1
//if that element is greater than the next element, it is possible that element itself could be the peak element OR it might be in the left space
